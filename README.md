# FORM-VALIDATION
This project focuses on creating a modern, user-friendly registration form with robust validation using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. Forms are critical for collecting user information on websites, and ensuring data accuracy and security is essential. 

**The form validation is designed to these criteria:**

-Full Name must be at least 5 characters long.<br>
-Email ID must contain the "@" character and be correctly formatted.<br>
-Phone Number must be a 10-digit number and cannot be "1234567890".<br>
-Password must be at least 8 characters long, should not be "password," and should not match the user's name.<br>
-Confirm Password must match the Password field.<br>

Whenever any of these criteria are not same, the form displays an appropriate error message, such as "Enter a valid email" or "Password is not strong."

The project emphasizes a visually appealing design with enhanced styling features like gradient backgrounds, rounded input fields, input icons, animations, and responsive design to ensure compatibility with various devices. The form uses JavaScript for real-time validation, providing immediate feedback to the user as they fill out the form, enhancing the user experience.

The project's code is clean, well-documented, and follows best practices for readability and maintainability. It is deployed on GitHub and Netlify, demonstrating a live, fully functional web form that combines modern aesthetics with practical functionality. This project serves as an example of how to create a user-friendly and visually appealing form with effective client-side validation, ensuring both data integrity and an engaging user experience.
